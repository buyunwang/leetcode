Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        compare_dict = {}
        for i in nums:
            if i in compare_dict:
                compare_dict[i]+=1
            else:
                compare_dict[i]=0
        return compare_dict.keys()[compare_dict.values().index(0)]
