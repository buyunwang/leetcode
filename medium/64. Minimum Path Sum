Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example:

Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.

        if not grid or not grid[0]: return 0
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if i == 0 and j == 0:
                    before = 0
                elif i == 0:
                    before = grid[i][j-1]
                elif j == 0:
                    before = grid[i-1][j]
                else:
                    before = min(grid[i-1][j], grid[i][j-1])
                grid[i][j] = before + grid[i][j]
        return grid[m-1][n-1]
